# Walkthrough of changes I've made

## Overview

I fixed the code partly so that I would know the basic gist of the code but since I think there will be a lot of changes that I know will make, it will be much easier for me just to create a new project based on the old code.

## Architecture

I created a full stack application where I used dotNet Core as my backend and React, Javascript, HTML, CSS as my front-end. 

For my backend, I used the microservices, domain driven, service-repository architecture. In my experience, 

## Task 1 - Fix some ugly code

Imagine yourself working at Joke Companyâ„¢. This company has an app that gets random Chuck Norris jokes and can substitute other peoples names into the joke instead of Chuck Norris'.

Your task as a professional developer is to clean up this app and make it something you can be proud of.

*Note: This is NOT a representation of our codebase, to be clear. We did have fun crafting this beauty however ;)*

## Task 2 - Write a report

Write a document explaining some of the improvements you made to the code, and why you did so.

## What do I need

- [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) - any platform
